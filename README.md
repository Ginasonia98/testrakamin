Project Description
This project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It incorporates several libraries and tools to enhance the functionality and visual appearance of the web application.

React Icons
React Icons is a collection of popular icon packs that can be easily integrated into a React application. It provides a wide range of icons to choose from, making it convenient to include visually appealing icons in your project.

Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly build custom user interfaces. It provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be applied to HTML elements, enabling quick and efficient styling. With Tailwind CSS, you can easily customize the appearance of your website without writing custom CSS.

React DnD
React DnD (Drag and Drop) is a powerful library for adding drag-and-drop functionality to your React application. It provides a set of components and hooks that simplify the process of creating draggable and droppable elements. With React DnD, you can easily implement features such as reordering lists or dragging items between different containers.
